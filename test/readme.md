## Automated Test Classes

This test class will automatically create a test main that runs ALL test classes that include the header `testrunner.h` and use the macro `DECLARE_TEST(*classname*)` at the bottom of the test class.

refer to the file `testclassExample.h` for a test class template. All test classes should run and have independant output and results.
